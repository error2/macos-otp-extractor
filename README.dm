OTP Extractor for macOSA lightweight and efficient macOS menu bar utility that automatically reads One-Time Passcodes (OTPs) from the Messages app and copies them to the clipboard.(Note: The menu now includes a rich history of recent codes.)OverviewThis application lives in your macOS menu bar and silently monitors for new messages that contain verification codes. When a new OTP is detected, it's instantly copied to your clipboard, saving you the time and effort of switching to the Messages app, finding the code, and copying it manually.FeaturesAutomatic OTP Detection: Uses regular expressions to find and extract 5-8 digit codes from incoming messages.Clipboard Integration: Automatically copies the found OTP to the system clipboard.Rich OTP History: The menu displays the last 3 codes that were captured, including the sender and the time the message was received. You can click any item in the history to copy it again.Visual Feedback: The menu bar icon provides instant visual feedback (e.g., a green checkmark) when a code is successfully copied.Auditory Feedback: Plays a subtle system sound to confirm an OTP has been copied.Efficient: Uses a timer to check for new messages periodically without consuming significant system resources.Manual Fetch: Includes a menu option to manually trigger a check for the last OTP.DownloadFor users who don't want to build from source, you can download the pre-compiled application here.Download OTP Extractor v1.0You can also visit the Releases page for all available versions.How It WorksThe app works by directly and securely reading the local chat.db SQLite database where the macOS Messages app stores all message history. It periodically checks for new entries, parses their content for a valid OTP, and if found, copies it to the clipboard and updates the history.This method is read-only and does not modify any of your messages or data.Setup & Installation (from Source)If you prefer to build the app yourself, follow these instructions.PrerequisitesA Mac running macOS.Xcode installed.Build InstructionsClone the Repository:git clone https://github.com/error2/macos-otp-extractor.git
cd macos-otp-extractor
Open in Xcode: Open the .xcodeproj file.Add Dependencies: In Xcode, go to File > Add Package Dependencies... and add the SQLite.swift package: https://github.com/stephencelis/SQLite.swift.git.Build the App: From the menu bar, select Product > Build (or press Cmd + B).Permissions (Crucial Step)For the app to read your messages, you must grant it Full Disk Access.After building the app, find OTPExtractor.app in the Products folder in Xcode's Project Navigator. Right-click and select "Show in Finder".Open System Settings > Privacy & Security > Full Disk Access.Click the + button and add the OTPExtractor.app file.Ensure the toggle next to the app is enabled.Final InstallationDrag the OTPExtractor.app file from the build folder into your main /Applications folder.(Recommended) To have the app launch on startup, go to System Settings > General > Login Items and add OTPExtractor to the list of apps to open at login.Technology StackLanguage: SwiftUI Framework: SwiftUI (for the app structure) and AppKit (for the menu bar item)Database: SQLite.swift for interacting with the Messages database.This project was created for personal use and demonstrates interaction with system files on macOS.
